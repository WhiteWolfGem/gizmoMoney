## Project Status

Currently in the planning/research stage

## Inspiration

A lot of inspiration has come from Microsoft Money Sunset which was released back in 2010. A lot of finance applications are now online and store all your finance data in the cloud while some don't mind this, others would rather not have their finance information out there in the interwebs and a lot of offline systems are no longer supported or lack some of the features. We have done lots of little weekend projects between us but nothing on a larger scale and as a team so we have decided to build our own personal finance system and have some fun along the way.

## About us

We are full-time developers but want to try something different from our regular jobs, learn some new technologies and have some fun. Are we experts in this? Not even slightly so feel free to laugh with us along the way but we do have our strengths and have developed business critical systems that are used by 1000s of people everyday. We also want to share our journey with you, whether you are a pro developer, newbie starting to learn your first language or just someone interested in our project and it's development. Jinxeth will be writing a blog and WhiteWolfGem will be creating a video diary and streaming development sessions, though there is no promise when and how often this these will be released.
